# pub-flow
Simple repo to fork from and begin experimenting working in Hubflow.

# Project Roadmap
These are things that we really need to do on the project.
Roughly speaking, each bullet point should be a new feature.

- PUB-1: Initialise a new [express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) project.
- PUB-2: Come up with a name for your pub and create a home page.
- PUB-3: Add a selection of beers in some service with name, color, description. Hard coded object is fine.
- PUB-4: Create a "beers" page to display a list of all beers available.
- PUB-5: Generate a "view" page for each beer when clicking on it in the list.
- PUB-6: Beautify the template with something like bootstrap.
- PUB-7: Add "Terms of Service" page, and a "Contact Us" page
